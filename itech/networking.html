							<h3>Networks Defined by Geography </h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/lanbg.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>As you might be sensing at this point, not all networks look the same. They vary in
								numerous ways. One criterion by which we can classify networks is how geographically
								dispersed the networks components are. For example, a network might interconnect
								devices within an office, or a network might interconnect a database at a
								corporate headquarters location with a remote sales office located on the opposite
								side of the globe. </p>
							<p>Based on the geographical dispersion of network components, networks can be classified
								into various categories, including the following: </p>
								<hr>
								<ul>
									<li><b style="color:red; font-family: rockwell;">Local-area network (LAN)</b></li>
								</ul>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/lan1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>A LAN interconnects network components within a local region (for example,
								within a building). Examples of common LAN technologies you’re likely to encounter
								include Ethernet (that is, IEEE 802.3) and wireless networks (that is, IEEE
								802.11). Figure 1-2 illustrates an example of a LAN. </p><br>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/lan.png" alt="" /></span>
							<hr>

							<ul>
								<li><b style="color:orange; font-family: rockwell;">Wide-area network (WAN) </b></li>
							</ul>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/wan2.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>A WAN interconnects network components that are geographically separated. For
								example, a corporate headquarters might have multiple WAN connections to remote
								office sites. Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), Asynchronous Transfer
								Mode (ATM), and Frame Relay are examples of WAN technologies. Figure 1-3
								depicts a simple WAN topology, which interconnects two geographically dispersed
								locations. </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/wan.png" alt="" /></span>
							<hr>
							<h6>Other Categories of Networks </h6>
							<p>Although LANs and WANs are the most common terms used to categorize computer
								networks based on geography, other categories include campus-area network
								(CAN), metropolitan-area network (MAN), and personal-area network (PAN). </p>
							<ul>
								<li><b style="color:yellow; font-family: rockwell;">Campus-area network (CAN) </b></li>
							</ul>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/can.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Years ago, I was a network manager for a university. The university covered several
								square miles and had several dozen buildings. Within many of these buildings was
								a LAN. However, those building-centric LANs were interconnected. By interconnecting
								these LANs, another network type was created, a CAN. Besides an actual
								university campus, a CAN might also be found in an industrial park or business
								park. </p>
							<ul>
							<hr>
								<li><b style="color:green; font-family: rockwell;">Metropolitan-area network (MAN) </b></li>
							</ul>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/man1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>More widespread than a CAN and less widespread than a WAN, a MAN interconnects
									locations scattered throughout a metropolitan area. Imagine, for example, that
									a business in Chicago had a location near O’Hare Airport, another location near
									the Navy Pier, and another location in the Sears Tower. If a service provider could
									interconnect those locations using a high-speed network, such as a 10-Gbps (that
									is, 10 billion bits per second) network, the interconnection of those locations would
									constitute a MAN. One example of a MAN technology is Metro Ethernet. </p>
							<hr>	
							<ul>
								<li><b style="color:blue; font-family: rockwell;">Personal-area network (PAN)  </b></li>
							</ul>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pan1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>A PAN is a network whose scale is even smaller than a LAN. As an example, a connection
									between a PC and a digital camera via a universal serial bus (USB) cable
									could be considered a PAN. Another example is a PC connected to an external
									hard drive via a FireWire connection. A PAN, however, is not necessarily a wired
									connection. A Bluetooth connection between your cell phone and your car’s audio
									system is considered a wireless PAN (WPAN). The main distinction of a PAN,
									however, is that its range is typically limited to just a few meters. </p>
							<hr>
							<h4>Networks Defined by Topology </h4>
							<p>In addition to classifying networks based on the geographical placement of their
									components, another approach to classifying a network is to use the network’s
									topology. Looks can be deceiving, however. You need to be able to distinguish between
									a physical topology and a logical topology. </p><br>
									<br>
							<h4>Physical Versus Logical Topology </h4>
							<p>Just because a network appears to be a star topology (that is, where the network
									components all connect back to a centralized device, such as a switch), the traffic
									might be flowing in a circular pattern through all the network components attached
									to the centralized device. The actual traffic flow determines the logical topology , while
									how components are physically interconnected determines the physical topology . </p>
							<p>As an example, consider Figure 1-4 . The figure shows a collection of computers
									connected to a Token Ring Media Access Unit (MAU). From a quick inspection
									of Figure 1-4 , you can conclude that the devices are physically connected in a star
									topology, where the connected devices radiate out from a centralized aggregation
									point (that is, the MAU in this example). </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/star.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h6><b>Figure 1-4</b>&nbsp;Physical Star Topology </h6>
							<p>Next, contrast the physical topology in Figure 1-4 with the logical topology illustrated
									in Figure 1-5 . Although the computers physically connect to a centralized
									MAU, when you examine the flow of traffic through (or in this case, around) the
									network, you see that the traffic flow actually loops round-and-round the network.
									The traffic flow dictates how to classify a network’s logical topology. In this instance,
									the logical topology is a ring topology , because the traffic circulates around the
									network as if circulating around a ring. 
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/star.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h6><b>Figure 1-5 </b>&nbsp;Logical Ring Topology</h6>
							<p>Although Token Ring, as used in this example, is rarely seen in modern networks, it
									illustrates how a network’s physical and logical topologies can be quite different. </p>
									<br><br>
							<h4>Bus Topology </h4>
							<p>A bus topology, as depicted in Figure 1-6 , typically uses a cable running through the
									area requiring connectivity. Devices that need to connect to the network then tap
									into this nearby cable. Early Ethernet networks commonly relied on bus topologies. </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/bus.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h6><b>Figure 1-6 </b>&nbsp;Bus Topology </h6>
							<p>A network tap might be in the form of a T connector (commonly used in older
									10BASE2 networks) or a vampire tap (commonly used in older 10BASE5 networks).
									Figure 1-7 shows an example of a T connector. </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/t_connector.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h6><b>Figure 1-7 </b>&nbsp;T Connector</h6>
							<blockquote><b>NOTE</b> The Ethernet standards mentioned here (that is, 10BASE2 and 10BASE5), in
									addition to many other Ethernet standards, are discussed in detail in Chapter 4 , “Understanding
									Ethernet.” </blockquote>
							<p>A bus and all devices connected to that bus make up a network segment . As discussed
									in Chapter 4 , a single network segment is a single collision domain, which means
									that all devices connected to the bus might try to gain access to the bus at the same
									time, resulting in an error condition known as a collision . Table 1-1 identifies some
									of the primary characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks of a bus topology. </p>
									<h3 class="major">Table 1-1 </h3>
									<h4>Characteristics, Benefits, and Drawbacks of a Bus Topology</h4>

									</div>
									<h4><b>Ring Topology</b></h4>
									<p>Figure 1-8 offers an example of a ring topology, where traffic flows in a circular
											fashion around a closed network loop (that is, a ring). Typically, a ring topology
											sends data, in a single direction, to each connected device in turn, until the intended
											destination receives the data. Token Ring networks typically relied on a ring topology, although the ring might have been the logical topology, while physically, the
											topology was a star topology. </p>
											<img src="images/ring.png" style="height: 200px; width:245px;">
											<p><b>Figure 1-8 </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ring Topology </p>
										<p>Token Ring, however, was not the only popular ring-based topology popular in networks back in the 1990s. Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) was another variant of a ring-based topology. Most FDDI networks (which, as the name suggests,
												have fiber optics as the media) used not just one ring, but two. These two rings
												sent data in opposite directions, resulting in counter-rotating rings . One benefit of
												counter-rotating rings was that if a fiber broke, the stations on each side of the break
												could interconnect their two rings, resulting in a single ring capable of reaching all
												stations on the ring. </p>
										<p>Because a ring topology allows devices on the ring to take turns transmitting on the
												ring, contention for media access was not a problem, as it was for a bus topology. If
												a network had a single ring, however, the ring became a single point of failure. If the
												ring were broken at any point, data would stop flowing. Table 1-2 identifies some of
												the primary characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks of a ring topology. 
												</p>

																			of time, it reports an error
																			condition (typically in the
																			form of an indicator light on a
																			network interface card [NIC]).</td>
																	<td>Rings have scalability
																			limitations. Specifically, a ring
																			has a maximum length and a

													<h4>Star Topology </h4>
													<p>Figure 1-9 shows a sample star topology with a hub at the center of the topology
															and a collection of clients individually connected to the hub. Notice that a star topology
															has a central point from which all attached devices radiate. In LANs, that
															centralized device was typically a hub back in the early 1990s. Modern networks,
															however, usually have a switch located at the center of the star. </p>
													<span class="image main"><img src="images/star.png" alt="" /></span>
													<h6><b>Figure 1-9 </b>&nbsp;Star Topology  </h6>
													<p>The star topology is the most popular physical LAN topology in use today, with an
															Ethernet switch at the center of the star and unshielded twisted-pair cable (UTP)

									<h2 class="major">Terms in Networking</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/OnlyAssuredCoati-max-1mb.gif" alt="" /></span>
									<p><strong>What comes to mind when you think of a </strong><strong style="color:red;">computer network?</strong> <strong style="color:orange;">Is it the Internet?</strong>
										<strong style="color:yellow;">Is it e-mail?</strong><strong> Is it the wireless connection that lets you print to your printer from
										your laptop?</strong> </p>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/find.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever your current perception of a computer network, this chapter 
										helps you gain deep appreciation and understanding of networked
										computing. Be aware that although we commonly think of computer
										networks as interconnecting computers, today, computer networks interconnect
										a variety of devices in addition to just computers. <br>Examples include game consoles,
										video-surveillance devices, and IP-based telephones. Therefore, throughout
										this, you can think of the term computer network as being synonymous
										with the more generic term network , as these terms will be used interchangeably. 
									</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this chapter, the goal is to acquaint you with the purpose of a network and
										help you categorize a given network based on criteria such as geography, topology,
										and the location of a network’s resources.</p><br>
										<hr>
									<h3>Defining a Network</h3>
										<blockquote>It was in the movie A Field of Dreams where they said, “If you build it, they will
												come.” That phrase most certainly applies to the evolution of network-based services
												seen in modern-day networks. Computer networks are no longer relegated to
												allowing a group of computers to access a common set of files stored on a computer
												designated as a file server . Instead, with the building of high-speed, highly redundant
												networks, network architects are seeing the wisdom of placing a variety of traffic
												types on a single network. Examples include voice and video, in addition to data. <br><br>
												One could argue that a network is the sum of its parts. So, as you begin your study
												of networking, you should grasp a basic understanding of fundamental networking
												components. These components include such entities as a client, server, hub, switch,
												router, and the media used to interconnect these devices. </blockquote>
									<h4>The Purpose of Networks </h4>
									<p>At its essence, a network’s purpose is to make connections. These connections might
											be between a PC and a printer or between a laptop and the Internet, as just a couple
											of examples. However, the true value of a network comes from the traffic flowing
											over those connections. Consider a sampling of applications that can travel over a
											network’s connections: </p>
											<ul>
												<li> <b>File sharing between two computers </b></li>
												<li> <b>Video chatting between computers located in different parts of the world  </b></li>
												<li> <b>Surfing the web (for example, to use social media sites, watch streaming video,
														listen to an Internet radio station, or do research for a school term paper)  </b></li>
												<li> <b>Instant messaging (IM) between computers with IM software installed </b></li>
												<li> <b>E-mail </b></li>
												<li> <b>Voice over IP (VoIP), to replace traditional telephony systems </b></li>
											</ul>
											<p>A term commonly given to a network transporting multiple types of traffic (for
													example, voice, video, and data) is a <b style="color:red;">converged network</b> . A converged network might
													offer significant cost savings to organizations that previously supported separate network
													infrastructures for voice, data, and video traffic. This convergence can also potentially
													reduce staffing costs, because only a single network needs to be maintained,
													rather than separate networks for separate traffic types. </p>
													<hr>
											<h4>Internet</h4>
											<blockquote>
													The Internet, sometimes called simply "the Net," is a worldwide system of computer networks -- a network of networks in which users at any one computer can, if they have permission, get information from any other computer (and sometimes talk directly to users at other computers).
											</blockquote>
											<h4>Connection</h4>
											<blockquote>
													In networking, a connection refers to pieces of related information that are transfered through a network. This generally infers that a connection is built before the data transfer (by following the procedures laid out in a protocol) and then is deconstructed at the at the end of the data transfer.
											</blockquote>
											<h4>Packet</h4>
											<blockquote>
													A packet is, generally speaking, the most basic unit that is transfered over a network. When communicating over a network, packets are the envelopes that carry your data (in pieces) from one end point to the other.
											</blockquote>
											<h4>Network Interface</h4>
											<blockquote>
													A network interface can refer to any kind of software interface to networking hardware. For instance, if you have two network cards in your computer, you can control and configure each network interface associated with them individually.
											</blockquote>
											<h4>LAN</h4>
											<blockquote>
													LAN stands for “local area network”. It refers to a network or a portion of a network that is not publicly accessible to the greater internet. A home or office network is an example of a LAN.
											</blockquote>
											<h4>WAN</h4>
											<blockquote>
													WAN stands for “wide area network”. It means a network that is much more extensive than a LAN. While WAN is the relevant term to use to describe large, dispersed networks in general, it is usually meant to mean the internet, as a whole.
											</blockquote>
											<h4>Protocol</h4>
											<blockquote>
													A protocol is a set of rules and standards that basically define a language that devices can use to communicate. There are a great number of protocols in use extensively in networking, and they are often implemented in different layers.
											</blockquote>
											<h4>Port</h4>
											<blockquote>
													A port is an address on a single machine that can be tied to a specific piece of software. It is not a physical interface or location, but it allows your server to be able to communicate using more than one application.
											</blockquote>
											<h4>Firewall</h4>
											<blockquote>
													A firewall is a program that decides whether traffic coming into a server or going out should be allowed. A firewall usually works by creating rules for which type of traffic is acceptable on which ports. Generally, firewalls block ports that are not used by a specific application on a server.
											</blockquote>
											<h4>NAT</h4>
											<blockquote>
													NAT stands for network address translation. It is a way to translate requests that are incoming into a routing server to the relevant devices or servers that it knows about in the LAN. This is usually implemented in physical LANs as a way to route requests through one IP address to the necessary backend servers.
											</blockquote>
											<h4>VPN</h4>
											<blockquote>
													VPN stands for virtual private network. It is a means of connecting separate LANs through the internet, while maintaining privacy. This is used as a means of connecting remote systems as if they were on a local network, often for security reasons.
											</blockquote>
											<h4>Application</h4>
											<blockquote>
													The application layer is the layer that the users and user-applications most often interact with. Network communication is discussed in terms of availability of resources, partners to communicate with, and data synchronization.
											</blockquote>
											<h4>Presentation</h4>
											<blockquote>
													The presentation layer is responsible for mapping resources and creating context. It is used to translate lower level networking data into data that applications expect to see.
											</blockquote>
											<h4>Session</h4>
											<blockquote>
													The session layer is a connection handler. It creates, maintains, and destroys connections between nodes in a persistent way.
											</blockquote>
											<h4>Transport</h4>
											<blockquote>
													The transport layer is responsible for handing the layers above it a reliable connection. In this context, reliable refers to the ability to verify that a piece of data was received intact at the other end of the connection
											</blockquote>
											<h4>Network</h4>
											<blockquote>
													The network layer is used to route data between different nodes on the network. It uses addresses to be able to tell which computer to send information to. This layer can also break apart larger messages into smaller chunks to be reassembled on the opposite end.
											</blockquote>
											<h4>Data Link</h4>
											<blockquote>
													This layer is implemented as a method of establishing and maintaining reliable links between different nodes or devices on a network using existing physical connections.
											</blockquote>
											<h4>Physical</h4>
											<blockquote>
													The physical layer is responsible for handling the actual physical devices that are used to make a connection. This layer involves the bare software that manages physical connections as well as the hardware itself (like Ethernet).

										<h2 class="major">The OSI Model </h2>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/osi.png" alt="" /></span>
										<strong> The OSI model is comprised of seven layers: 
										</strong>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Layer 1:</b><strong style="color:violet;">&nbsp;The physical layer</strong> </li>
											<li><b>Layer 2:</b><strong style="color:red;">&nbsp;The data link layer </strong></li>
											<li><b>Layer 3:</b><strong style="color:orange;">&nbsp;The network layer</strong> </li>
											<li><b>Layer 4:</b><strong style="color:yellow;">&nbsp;The transport layer</strong></li>
											<li><b>Layer 5:</b><strong style="color:green;">&nbsp;The session layer </strong></li>
											<li><b>Layer 6:</b><strong style="color:skyblue;">&nbsp;The presentation layer </strong></li>
											<li><b>Layer 7:</b><strong style="color:blue;">&nbsp;The application layer </strong></li>
										</ul>
										<p>Various mnemonics are available to help memorize these layers in their proper order.
												A top-down (that is, starting at the top of the stack with Layer 7 and working
												your way down to Layer 1) acrostic is All People Seem To Need Data Processing . As a
												couple of examples, using this acrostic, the A in A ll reminds us of the A in A pplication,
												and the P in P eople reminds us of the P in P resentation. 
										</p><br>
										<p>At the physical layer, binary expressions (that is, a series of 1s and 0s) represent data.
												A binary expression is made up of bits, where a bit is a single 1 or a single 0. At upper
												layers, however, bits are grouped together, into what is known as a protocol data
												unit (PDU) or a data service unit . 
										</p><br>
										<p>The term packet is used fairly generically to refer to these PDUs. However, PDUs
												might have an additional name, depending on their OSI layer. Figure 2-3 illustrates
												these PDU names. A common memory aid for these PDUs is the acrostic Some
												People Fear Birthdays , where the S in S ome reminds us of the S in S egments. The P
												in P eople reminds us of the P in P ackets, and the F in F ear reflects the F in F rames.

								<p>What comes to mind when you think of a computer network? Is it the Internet?
								Is it e-mail? Is it the wireless connection that lets you print to your printer from
								your laptop? </p><img src="images/OnlyAssuredCoati-max-1mb.gif" style="width: 200px; height: 200px;"/>
								<br>
								
								Whatever your current perception of a computer network, this chapter and 
								as a whole, helps you gain deep appreciation and <strong>understanding of networked computing</strong>. Be aware that although we commonly think of computer
								networks as interconnecting computers, today, computer networks interconnect
								a variety of devices in addition to just computers. Examples include game consoles, <b style="color:red;">video-surveillance devices</b>, and <b style="color:orange;">IP-based telephones</b>. Therefore, 
								throughout this, you can think of the term computer network as being synonymous
								with the more generic term network , as these terms will be used interchangeably.
								In this chapter, the goal is to acquaint you with the purpose of a network and
								help you categorize a given network based on criteria such as geography, topology, and the location of a network’s resources. An implied goal of this and all
								other chapters in this book is to prepare you to successfully pass the CompTIA
								Network+ exam, which is considered to be a cornerstone exam in the information technology (IT) industry. 
							<hr>
								<h3>Defining a Network</h3>
								<p>It was in the movie A Field of Dreams where they said, <i>“If you build it, they will
									come.”</i> That phrase most certainly applies to the evolution of network-based services seen in modern-day networks. Computer networks are no longer relegated to
									allowing a group of computers to access a common set of files stored on a computer
									designated as a file server . Instead, with the building of high-speed, highly redundant
									networks, network architects are seeing the wisdom of placing a variety of traffic
									types on a single network. <strong>include voice and video, in addition to data.</strong>  </p>
								<p>One could argue that a network is the sum of its parts. So, as you begin your study
									of networking, you should grasp a basic understanding of fundamental networking
									components. These components include such entities as a <b style="color:red;">client</b>, <b style="color:orange;">server</b>, <b style="color:yellow;">hub</b>, <b style="color:green;"></b>,
									<b style="color:lightblue;">router</b>, and <strong>the media used to interconnect these devices. </strong></p>
								<h4>The Purpose of Networks</h4>
								At its essence, a network’s purpose is to make connections. These connections might
								be between a PC and a printer or between a laptop and the Internet, as just a couple
								of examples. However, the true value of a network comes from the traffic flowing
								over those connections. Consider a sampling of applications that can travel over a
								network’s connections: 
								<ul>
									<li>File sharing between two computers</li>
									<li>Video chatting between computers located in different parts of the world </li>
									<li>Surfing the web (for example, to use social media sites, watch streaming video,
										listen to an Internet radio station, or do research for a school term paper) </li>
									<li>Instant messaging (IM) between computers with IM software installed </li>
									<li>E-mail</li>
									<li>Voice over IP (VoIP), to replace traditional telephony systems</li>
								</ul>
								<p>A term commonly given to a network transporting multiple types of traffic (for
								example, voice, video, and data) is a converged network . A converged network might
								offer significant cost savings to organizations that previously supported separate network infrastructures for voice, data, and video traffic. This convergence can also potentially reduce staffing costs, because only a single network needs to be maintained,
								rather than separate networks for separate traffic types. </p>
								<h4>Overview of Network Components</h4>
								<p>Designing, installing, administering, and troubleshooting a network requires the
									ability to recognize various network components and their functions. Although this
									is the focus of Chapter 3 , “Identifying Network Components,” before we can proceed much further, we need a basic working knowledge of how individual components come together to form a functioning network. 
								</p>
								<p>The components to consider for now are client, server, hub, switch, router, media,
									and wide-area network (WAN) link. As a reference for this discussion, consider
									Figure 1-1 </p>
									<img id="myImg" src="images/sample_computer_network.png" alt="Snow" style="width:100%;max-width:300px">


								<p>The following list describes the network components depicted in Figure 1-1 and the
									functions they serve: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b style="color: rgb(178, 32, 32)">Client</b>: The term client defines the device an end user uses to access a network.
											This device might be a workstation, laptop, smartphone with wireless capabilities, or a variety of other end-user terminal devices. 
										</li>
										<li>
											<b style="color: rgb(255, 60, 0)">Server</b>: A server , as the name suggests, serves up resources to a network. These
											resources might include e-mail access as provided by an e-mail server, web
											pages as provided by a web server, or files available on a file server. 
										</li>
										<li>
											<b style="color: rgb(233, 210, 0)">Hub</b>: A hub is an older technology that interconnects network components,
											such as clients and servers. Hubs vary in their number of available ports. However, for scalability, hubs can be interconnected, up to a point. If too many
											hubs are chained together, network errors can result. As discussed further
											in Chapter 3 , a hub does not perform any inspection of the traffic it passes. 
											Rather, a hub simply receives traffic in a port (that is, a receptacle to which a
											network cable connects) and repeats that traffic out all of the other ports. <br>
											<button style="width: 150px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);">Hub</button>
										</li>
										<li>
											<b style="color: rgb(255, 230, 0)">Switch</b>: Like a hub, a switch interconnects network components, and they are
											available with a variety of port densities. However, unlike a hub, a switch does
											not simply take traffic in on one port and blast that traffic out all other ports.
											Rather, a switch learns which devices reside off of which ports. As a result,
											when traffic comes in a switch port, the switch interrogates the traffic to see
											where it is destined. Then, based on what the switch has learned, the switch
											forwards the traffic out of the appropriate port, and not out all of the other
											ports. This dramatically cuts down on the volume of traffic coursing through
											your network. A switch is considered a Layer 2 device, which means that it
											makes its forwarding decisions based on addresses that are physically burned
											into a network interface card (NIC) installed in a host (that is, any device that
											transmits or receives traffic on a network). This burned-in address is a Media
											Access Control (MAC) address.<br>
											<button style="width: 150px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);">Switch</button>
										</li>
										<li>
											<b style="color: rgb(238, 255, 0)">Router</b>: As discussed in Chapter 3 , a router is considered to be a Layer 3 device,
											which means that it makes its forwarding decisions based on logical network
											addresses. Most modern networks use Internet Protocol (IP) addressing. Therefore, most routers know what logical IP networks reside off of which router
											interfaces. Then, when traffic comes into a router, the router examines the
											destination IP address of the traffic and, based on the router’s database of networks (that is, the routing table), the router intelligently forwards the traffic
											out the appropriate interface.<br>
											<button style="width: 150px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);">Router</button>
										</li>
										<li>
											<b style="color: rgb(179, 255, 0)">Media</b>: The previously mentioned devices need to be interconnected via some
											sort of media . This media could be copper cabling. It could be a fiber-optic
											cable. Media might not even be a cable, as is the case with wireless networks,
											where radio waves travel through the media of air. Chapter 3 expands on this
											discussion of media. For now, realize that media varies in its cost, bandwidth
											capacity, and distance limitation. For example, although fiber-optic cabling
											is more expensive than unshielded twisted-pair cabling, it can typically carry
											traffic over longer distances and has a greater bandwidth capacity (that is, the
											capacity to carry a higher data rate). 
										</li>
										<li>
											<b style="color: rgb(72, 255, 0)">WAN link</b>: Today, most networks connect to one or more other networks.
											For example, if your company has two locations, and those two locations are
											interconnected (perhaps via a Frame Relay or Multiprotocol Label Switching [MPLS] network), the link that interconnects those networks is typically
											referred to as a wide-area network (WAN) link. WANs, and technologies
											supporting WANs , “Introducing Wide-Area
											Networks.” 
										</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Networks Defined by Geography</h3>
									<p>As you might be sensing at this point, not all networks look the same. They vary in
											numerous ways. One criterion by which we can classify networks is how geographically dispersed the networks components are. For example, a network might interconnect devices within an office, or a network might interconnect a database at a
											corporate headquarters location with a remote sales office located on the opposite
											side of the globe. </p>
									<p>Based on the geographical dispersion of network components, networks can be classified into various categories, including the following: </p>
									<ul>
										<li style="list-style: none;">■ <a href="#lan">Local-area network (LAN)</a> </li>
										<li style="list-style: none;">■ <a href="#wan">Wide-area network (WAN) </a> </li>
										<li style="list-style: none;">■ <a href="#can">Campus-area network (CAN) </a> </li>
										<li style="list-style: none;">■ <a href="#man">Metropolitan-area network (MAN) </a></li>
										<li style="list-style: none;">■ <a href="#pan">Personal-area network (PAN) </a></li>
									</ul><br>
									<p>The following sections describe these different classifications of networks in more
											detail. </p>
										<h3 id="lan"><b>LAN</b></h3>
										<p>A LAN interconnects network components within a local region (for example,
												within a building). Examples of common LAN technologies you’re likely to encounter include Ethernet (that is, IEEE 802.3) and wireless networks (that is, IEEE
												802.11). Figure 1-2 illustrates an example of a LAN. </p>
											<img id="networkClassifications" src="images/lan.png" style="width: 240px; height: 200px;">
											<p><b>Figure 1-2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample Lan Topology </p>
											<blockquote>NOTE IEEE stands for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers , and it is an
													internationally recognized standards body. </blockquote>
											<h3 id="wan"><b>WAN</b></h3>
											A WAN interconnects network components that are geographically separated. For
											example, a corporate headquarters might have multiple WAN connections to remote office sites. Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), Asynchronous Transfer
											Mode (ATM), and Frame Relay are examples of WAN technologies. Figure 1-3
											depicts a simple WAN topology, which interconnects two geographically dispersed
											locations. 
											<img src="images/wan.png" style="width: 240px; height: 215px;">
											<p><b>Figure 1-3</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample Wan Topology </p>
											<h3><b>Other Categories of networks</b></h3>

												<p>Although LANs and WANs are the most common terms used to categorize computer networks based on geography, other categories include campus-area network
														(CAN), metropolitan-area network (MAN), and personal-area network (PAN). </p>
											<h3 id="can"><b>CAN</b></h3>
											<blockquote>
											<p>Years ago, I was a network manager for a university. The university covered several
											square miles and had several dozen buildings. Within many of these buildings was
											a LAN. However, those building-centric LANs were interconnected. By interconnecting these LANs, another network type was created, a CAN. Besides an actual
											university campus, a CAN might also be found in an industrial park or business
											park. </p></blockquote>
											
											<h3 id="man"><b>MAN</b></h3><blockquote>
											<p>More widespread than a CAN and less widespread than a WAN, a MAN interconnects locations scattered throughout a metropolitan area. Imagine, for example, that
											a business in Chicago had a location near O’Hare Airport, another location near
											the Navy Pier, and another location in the Sears Tower. If a service provider could
											interconnect those locations using a high-speed network, such as a 10-Gbps (that
											is, 10 billion bits per second) network, the interconnection of those locations would
											constitute a MAN. One example of a MAN technology is Metro Ethernet. </p>
										</blockquote>
											<h3 id="pan"><b>PAN</b></h3><blockquote>
											<p>A PAN is a network whose scale is even smaller than a LAN. As an example, a connection between a PC and a digital camera via a universal serial bus (USB) cable
											could be considered a PAN. Another example is a PC connected to an external
											hard drive via a FireWire connection. A PAN, however, is not necessarily a wired
											connection. A Bluetooth connection between your cell phone and your car’s audio
											system is considered a wireless PAN (WPAN). The main distinction of a PAN,
											however, is that its range is typically limited to just a few meters. </p>
										</blockquote>
										
											<h3><b>Networks Defined by Topology</b></h3>
												<p>In addition to classifying networks based on the geographical placement of their
														components, another approach to classifying a network is to use the network’s
														topology. Looks can be deceiving, however. You need to be able to distinguish between a physical topology and a logical topology.
													 </p>
											<h4><b>Physical Versus Logical Topology</b></h4>
											<p>Just because a network appears to be a star topology (that is, where the network
													components all connect back to a centralized device, such as a switch), the traffic
													might be flowing in a circular pattern through all the network components attached
													to the centralized device. The actual traffic flow determines the logical topology , while
													how components are physically interconnected determines the physical topology . 
												</p>
											<img src="images/star.png" style="height: 200px; width:240px;">
											<p><b>Figure 1-4</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical Star Topology </p>
												<p>Next, contrast the physical topology in Figure 1-4 with the logical topology illustrated in Figure 1-5 . Although the computers physically connect to a centralized
														MAU, when you examine the flow of traffic through (or in this case, around) the
														network, you see that the traffic flow actually loops round-and-round the network.
														The traffic flow dictates how to classify a network’s logical topology. In this instance, the logical topology is a ring topology , because the traffic circulates around the
														network as if circulating around a ring. </p>
												<p>Although Token Ring, as used in this example, is rarely seen in modern networks, it
														illustrates how a network’s physical and logical topologies can be quite different. </p>
											<h4><b>Bus Topology</b></h4>
													<p>A bus topology, as depicted in Figure 1-6 , typically uses a cable running through the
															area requiring connectivity. Devices that need to connect to the network then tap
															into this nearby cable. Early Ethernet networks commonly relied on bus topologies. 
													</p>
											<img src="images/bus.png" style="height: 200px; width:240px;">
													<p>A network tap might be in the form of a T connector (commonly used in older
															10BASE2 networks) or a vampire tap (commonly used in older 10BASE5 networks).
															Figure 1-7 shows an example of a T connector. </p>
											<img src="images/t_connector.png" style="height: 200px; width:240px;">
											<p><b>Figure 1-7</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;T Connector </p>

											<blockquote>
													<p>NOTE The Ethernet standards mentioned here (that is, 10BASE2 and 10BASE5), in
													addition to many other Ethernet standards, are discussed in detail in Chapter 4 , “Understanding Ethernet.”
												</p></blockquote>

											<p>A bus and all devices connected to that bus make up a network segment . As discussed
													in Chapter 4 , a single network segment is a single collision domain, which means
													that all devices connected to the bus might try to gain access to the bus at the same
													time, resulting in an error condition known as a collision . Table 1-1 identifies some
													of the primary characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks of a bus topology. </p>
												
													<h3 class="major">Table 1-1 </h3>
													<h4>Characteristics, Benefits, and Drawbacks of a Bus Topology</h4>

														</table>
													</div>
													<h4><b>Ring Topology</b></h4>
													<p>Figure 1-8 offers an example of a ring topology, where traffic flows in a circular
															fashion around a closed network loop (that is, a ring). Typically, a ring topology
															sends data, in a single direction, to each connected device in turn, until the intended
															destination receives the data. Token Ring networks typically relied on a ring topology, although the ring might have been the logical topology, while physically, the
															topology was a star topology. </p>
															<img src="images/ring.png" style="height: 200px; width:245px;">
															<p><b>Figure 1-8 </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ring Topology </p>
														<p>Token Ring, however, was not the only popular ring-based topology popular in networks back in the 1990s. Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) was another variant of a ring-based topology. Most FDDI networks (which, as the name suggests,
																have fiber optics as the media) used not just one ring, but two. These two rings
																sent data in opposite directions, resulting in counter-rotating rings . One benefit of
																counter-rotating rings was that if a fiber broke, the stations on each side of the break
																could interconnect their two rings, resulting in a single ring capable of reaching all
																stations on the ring. </p>
														<p>Because a ring topology allows devices on the ring to take turns transmitting on the
																ring, contention for media access was not a problem, as it was for a bus topology. If
																a network had a single ring, however, the ring became a single point of failure. If the
																ring were broken at any point, data would stop flowing. Table 1-2 identifies some of
																the primary characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks of a ring topology. 
																</p>
