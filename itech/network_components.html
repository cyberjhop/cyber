							<h2>Hub</h2>
							<p>A hub is an older technology that interconnects network components, such as clients and servers. Hubs vary in their number of available ports. However, for scalability, hubs can be interconnected, up to a point. If too many hubs are chained together, network errors can result. As discussed further in Chapter 3 , a hub does not perform any inspection of the traffic it passes. Rather, a hub simply receives traffic in a port (that is, a receptacle to which a network cable connects) and repeats that traffic out all of the other ports.

							<h2>Switch</h2>
							<p>
								Like a hub, a switch interconnects network components, and they are available with a variety of port densities. 
								A switch is considered a Layer 2 device, which means that it makes its forwarding decisions based on addresses that are physically burned into a network interface card (NIC) installed in a host (that is, any device that transmits or receives traffic on a network). 
								This burned-in address is a Media Access Control (MAC) address.

							<h2>Router</h2>
							<p>A router is considered to be a Layer 3 device, which means that it makes its forwarding decisions based on logical network addresses. Most modern networks use Internet Protocol (IP) addressing. Therefore, most routers know what logical IP networks reside off of which router interfaces. Then, when traffic comes into a router, the router examines the destination IP address of the traffic and, based on the router’s database of networks (that is, the routing table), the router intelligently forwards the traffic out the appropriate interface.

					<h2>Repeater</h2>
					<p>A network device used to regenerate or replicate a signal. Repeaters are used in transmission systems to regenerate analog or digital signals distorted by transmission loss. Analog repeaters frequently can only amplify the signal while digital repeaters can reconstruct a signal to near its original quality.

			<h2>Media</h2>

			The previously mentioned devices need to be interconnected via some

			cable. Media might not even be a cable, as is the case with wireless networks,
			where radio waves travel through the media of air. Chapter 3 expands on this
			discussion of media. For now, realize that media varies in its cost, bandwidth
			capacity, and distance limitation. For example, although fiber-optic cabling
			is more expensive than unshielded twisted-pair cabling, it can typically carry
			traffic over longer distances and has a greater bandwidth capacity (that is, the
			capacity to carry a higher data rate).

		<h2>WAN Link</h2>
		<p>
		Today, most networks connect to one or more other networks.
		For example, if your company has two locations, and those two locations are
		interconnected (perhaps via a Frame Relay or Multiprotocol Label Switching
		[MPLS] network), the link that interconnects those networks is typically
		referred to as a wide-area network (WAN) link. WANs, and technologies
		supporting WANs, are covered in Chapter 7 , “Introducing Wide-Area
		Networks.”

	<h2>Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) Cable</h2>
	<p>It is a special kind of copper telephone wiring used in business installations. An external shield which functions as a ground is added to the normal twisted pair telephone wires. Shielded twisted pair may be the answer if you want to place the cable in an area with potential interference and risk to the electrical current in the UTP. Shielded cables can also help in expanding the distance between the cables.</p>

	<p>Most UTP cabling used in today’s networks is considered to be straight-through ,
			meaning that the RJ-45 jacks at each end of a cable have matching pinouts. For example,
			pin 1 in an RJ-45 jack at one end of a cable uses the same copper conductor
			as pin 1 in the RJ-45 jack at the other end of a cable. </p>
